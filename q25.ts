/**Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color 
and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
Write an if statement to test whether the alienâ€™s color is green. If it is, 
print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
*Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails.
